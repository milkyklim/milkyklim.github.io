Hold on for a sec -- I didn't get German citizenship. It's somethig better: 

> I am a proud citizen of _Banano Republic_ now! 

If this doesn't make sense for you, have a look at project [webpage](https://banano.cc){:target="_blank"} and educate yourself about crypto a little bit. Banano webpage gives pretty solid intro to all crypto memes that are out there. 

In a meanwhile, I will enjoy Banano rains trying to catch as many Banano as I can. And no, I didn't go crazy.
