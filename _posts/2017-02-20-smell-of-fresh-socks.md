I finally got a washing machine. Might be handy since I am wearing my last pair of socks.

*E:18 on the display*. Looks like the filter is clogged.

Spent this evening to find a piece of bra and an old sock inside of the filter.

Started the washing machine again. Never enjoyed the smell of the fresh socks that much.
