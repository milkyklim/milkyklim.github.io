It is Sunday and I am done with the [Berlin half marathon 2017](http://www.berliner-halbmarathon.de){:target="_blank"}.

My official timing:

km | time | min/km
:---:|:-----:|:-----:
5  | 0:27:24 | 05:29
10 | 0:55:24 | 05:37
15 | 1:25:32 | 06:02
21 | 2:02:41 | 06:06

The first 10 km look great. My optimistic goal was to finish in 1:45:00 and realistic goal was to beat 2:00:00. But I failed to accomplish any of these goals.

During my 1<sup>st</sup> km I wanted to adjust my speed and find the best tempo. The watch showed 5:45 and I decided to push it a little bit further. I was running behind the guy until the 9<sup>th</sup> km. His average was 5:20. Enough to cross the finish line in less than 2 hours.

But at the 10<sup>th</sup> km I have realized that I couldn't follow him any more. I suddenly felt super exhausted. My 1 km time jumped to 5:40 and degraded to 6:00 on average.

Turns out it is a bad idea to have only 2 trainings before running the half marathon.

> Practice makes perfect.

_Side note:_  
- It feels so good when a girl from the crowd shouts your name. :)  
- The prize for the best poster goes to the guys with _"Smile you have paid for this"_ poster.
