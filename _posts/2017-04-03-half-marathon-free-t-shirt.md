The registration for the half marathon was quite long. When I finally reached the registration desk I got a sticker and a timing chip. A little bit later I received a bag with useless journals, shower gel and deodorant for women.

But I was looking for a T-shirt. I have seen adidas among sponsors and was sure that there should be an event T-shirt (Last time I messed it up – forgot to take the T-shirt – and had to go to the registration again).

This time I wanted everything to go smooth. Walking through different halls I was confused by the appearing shops and the fact that they were selling event T-shirts. Why do you sell them if we should get them anyways?

It took me a while to spot the _"pre-ordered T-shirts"_ sign.

I immediately noticed how frustrated was the guy at the counter. He was in the non-stop yelling mode. I waited until he finished his conversation with another guy and passed him my starting number:

_(All in German)_

> \- What do you want?  
> \- T-shirt, L-size.  
> \- Why?!  
> \- Because it fits me the best.  

Next day I was curious why there were so few people wearing the event T-shirt. Laura told me that I had to pay for it. Then I assembled pieces together...

The guy's _"why"_ meant _"You idiot! You have never ordered a T-shirt and you can't get it now!"_. But I was sure he wanted to propose me an M-size.

_Side note:_  
I can't imagine people paying for this. The material sucks so much that it chafes the nipples. Well done adidas!
