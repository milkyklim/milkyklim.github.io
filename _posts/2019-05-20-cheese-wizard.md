For some reason "behaving as an adult" includes car purchase and house mortgage but misses the point --- _life is something you should enjoy_.

To make sure that I am doing everything right I've bought a cheese wizard today:

Yes, this wizard (who is basically a hashcode) costs real money but now I can participate in the tournament to get the Big Cheese title!

If you want to get your own cheese wizard (I see no reason why you wouldn't have one) head to [cheezewizards.com](https://www.cheezewizards.com){:target="_blank"}. You might be surprised that price of the elemental wizard is above 200$ now. :see_no_evil:
