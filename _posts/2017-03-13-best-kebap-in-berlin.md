Finally, checked out [Mustafa's Gemüse Kebap](https://goo.gl/maps/KoHzc7HPyHn){:target="_blank"} -- said to be "the best Döner in Berlin".
I doubt this title but it is remarkable that they grill the vegetables.

If you want to skip the line come to the shop around 10:00 - 10:30. I had to take the day-off to do that!

I recommend to go to [Al Safa](https://goo.gl/maps/i1GB98m7CkR2){:target="_blank"} to compare other available Döner-market options.
